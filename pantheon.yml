workflows:
  sync_code:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Run database updates, import config and clear caches. sync_code worflow only occurs on dev and multidev envs.
          sync_code occurs when a branch is pushed to.
        script: private/scripts/quicksilver/drush_update_import/drush_update_import.php
  deploy:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Run database updates, import config and clear caches. deploy workflow occurs only on test, live envs. If you deploy
          using lando env-deploy (recommended), these commands will be run by that script. However, we also need this hook to ensure
          these commands are run when someone deploys using the Pantheon dashboard instead. This means that when the deploy script
          is used, drush commands are actually run twice, but that should hopefully not be an issue.

  clone_database:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Run database updates, import config and clear caches. clone_database is run when a database is cloned to another env.
        script: private/scripts/quicksilver/drush_update_import/drush_update_import.php
  create_cloud_development_environment:
    after:
      - type: webphp
        description: Run database updates, import config and clear caches. create_cloud_development_environment workflow occurs after a multidev env
          is created. It seems clone_database is unreliable for this purpose and sometimes results
          in multidevs being created where config import has not been run.
