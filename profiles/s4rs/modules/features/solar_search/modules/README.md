This module is largely stolen from the views_exposed_groups module that exists
on Drupal. However, the main idea behind that module is to alter the output of
the exposed form at the form level. Since most other contributed modules aren't
dynamic enough to handle that kind of alteration, we're doing it on the theme
level instead.
